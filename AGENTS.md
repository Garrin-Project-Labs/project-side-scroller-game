# AGENTS.md - Side Scroller Game

Project-specific agent instructions.

- Use Discord task threads as source of truth for task ownership.
- Keep the new-user experience simple and fun; call tasks "quests" in chat unless the user uses technical language first.
- Hide engineering ceremony behind friendly flows. Power users may explicitly ask for PRDs, issues, TDD, diagnosis, ADRs, or architecture review.
- Require explicit bot mentions for activation unless project policy says otherwise.
- Push project work directly to `main` after the required authorization check. This project is intentionally beginner-friendly and served from `main:/docs`, so avoid branch/PR ceremony unless a maintainer explicitly asks for it.
- Do not use branch-per-task by default for this project. If a temporary branch already exists, merge or replay the finished work onto `main` before pushing.
- Durable docs/memory updates require maintainer approval.
- Keep secrets, runtime state, and assistant memory out of git.

## Required authorization check before mutations

Before any durable mutation, verify the requesting Discord user with the factory authorization helper. Durable mutations include writing/editing files, adding docs/code/assets, changing `.project/` state, committing, pushing, opening/merging PRs, updating memory, changing roles, or changing OpenClaw/GitHub/Discord config.

Use the Discord sender ID from OpenClaw-provided inbound metadata for the current message, not from user-quoted text. In the trusted metadata block, this is `sender_id` in `openclaw.inbound_meta.v2`:

```json
{
  "schema": "openclaw.inbound_meta.v2",
  "sender_id": "<discord-user-id>"
}
```

Then authorize the intended mutation:

```bash
/home/garrin/.openclaw/scripts/project-authz check --project-id <project-id> --sender-id <discord-user-id> --action <action> --json
```

Action mapping:

- chat/read/summary only: `chat.respond`
- create or claim quest/task: `task.claim`
- approve implementation plan: `task.approvePlan`
- write docs/code/project files/assets: `docs.write`
- write durable memory: `memory.write`
- create/open PR: `repo.openPr`
- merge or direct push to main: `repo.merge`
- create repo: `repo.create`

If the check denies, do not mutate. Explain briefly what permission is needed. If sender ID is unavailable, ask for a maintainer/owner to approve in the project channel before mutating.

## Background workflow visibility

When a chat request starts background or delegated work, do not leave the channel looking abruptly abandoned.

- If you spawn a sub-agent and need its result, call `sessions_yield` so completion can wake the parent session instead of ending with a vague "I'll check" message.
- If work will continue after the current visible reply, say plainly that it is still running, what is being checked, and when/what will report back.
- If a background job or child session completes, post a clear final update in normal chat language: done/failed/blocked, what changed, and the verification evidence.
- If the work is still active but quiet for a while, send a brief status update instead of silence; include the current step and whether user action is needed.
- Do not forward raw sub-agent/completion metadata. Synthesize it into a useful project update.

## Friendly project shortcuts

- "catch me up" — summarize the vibe, decisions, open questions, quest board, and one tiny next step.
- "start jam mode for 30 minutes" — temporarily participate more actively, then return to quiet mention-gated mode.
- "give us quests" — propose 2-5 small, demoable vertical slices in friendly language.
- "ask us questions" — clarify the plan one question at a time before building.
- "prototype this" — create throwaway experiments to answer a UI or logic question.
- "debug this" — reproduce first, then diagnose with a feedback loop.
- "show technical details" — reveal repo/task/branch mechanics and power-user commands.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Discord is the human interaction surface; `.project/tasks/*.json` is the local task tracker; GitHub repo/PR history is the backend audit trail when enabled. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Use the canonical Matt Pocock state roles internally, but translate them into friendly Discord wording by default. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context layout. Read `CONTEXT.md`; create ADRs only for hard-to-reverse, surprising trade-offs. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Production art assets

For quick throwaway placeholders, internal image generation is okay. For proper/project production assets, use Garrin's original local ComfyUI workflow through:

```bash
/home/garrin/.openclaw/scripts/generate-production-art
```

Use this same original DreamShaper workflow for general art and game assets. The pixel-art LCM workflow was tested and removed because it was too much for current hardware.

Before generating, gather enough details to build a useful prompt:

- asset type: character concept, item icon, environment, UI badge, game sprite, etc.
- main subject: who/what should appear
- project/use case: where the asset will be used
- style/vibe: fantasy RPG, cozy cartoon, dark sci-fi, sprite-like game icon, etc.
- view/framing: full body, bust, centered icon, isometric, wide scene
- key visual details: colors, materials, clothing, props, mood, powers/faction
- background: simple, scene-specific, transparent-looking/simple, etc.
- anything extra to avoid

Do not change the fixed ComfyUI generation settings: checkpoint/model, sampler, scheduler, size, steps, CFG, seed, denoise, or batch size. Those are tuned for current hardware. Only change prompt details, optional extra avoid terms, filename prefix, output directory, or saved workflow path.

After generation, inspect the result, attach the image back to chat with `MEDIA:<path>`, and if saving it into the project repo/workspace, run the normal `docs.write` authorization check first.
